This is a web app version of the Game of Thrones board game.

This started out as a project to learn MVC/Javascript/Entity Framework so I could transition from a Business Analyst to a Web Developer at my company. While the project never finished, I got enough experience that my company gave me the chance at development and I've been in this poistion since 6/12. Now that I've learned a lot more I'm coming back to do it right, as the original version was a rats nest of terrible code. I'll be using kineticJS to handle the canvas creation and interaction, knockoutJS for the viewModel, with MVC for all server-side operations.
